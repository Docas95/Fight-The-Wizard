# Fight-The-Wizard
A 2D side scroller game made with Godot.

## What's this game about?

Like that title says... you fight a wizard!

A long time ago, a wizard went mad and trapped the people of his kingdom inside a cursed dungeon. Thankfully, after many years of pain and suffering, a brave knight is here to save the day.

In this game, you get to explore the cursed dungeon, fight enemies and receive help from the people the wizar trapped. Eventually, if you're skilled enough, you will find the Wizard's castle and fight him.


## How far along in progress is this game?

As of today (29-09-2024) the game is about 5% complete.

### Current to-do list

- Polish player movement Script
- Implement a basic fighting system
- Implement game UI (start screen, inventory, HP bar, pause menu)

## Why did you make this game?

I wanted to learn how to use the Godot Engine to make cool games.
Eventually I would like to be able to contribute to Godot, since it's an Open Source program.
